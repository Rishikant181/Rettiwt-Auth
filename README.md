## Getting started

The following examples will help you to get started with using the library:

### 1. Authenticating as a guest user

```
import { Auth } from 'rettiwt-auth';

new Auth().getGuestCredential().then(credential => {
    ...
})
```

Where,

-   credential is the generated guest credential.

### 2. Authenticating as a logged-in user

```
import { Auth } from 'rettiwt-auth';

new Auth().getUserCredential({
    email: 'account_email',
    userName: 'account_username',
    password: 'account_password
}).then(credential => {
    ...
})
```

Where,

-   account_email is the email id associated with your Twitter account.
-   account_username is the username associated with your Twitter account.
-   account_password is the password to your Twitter account.
-   credential is the generated user credential.

## Authenticating against Twitter API

After the credentials have been generated:

1.  Generate the credential using any one of the two methods given above.
2.  Use the [toHeader()](https://rishikant181.github.io/Rettiwt-Auth/classes/AuthCredential.html#toHeader) method on the returned credential, which converts the credential into HTTP headers.
3.  Add the returned HTTP headers to the headers of the requests made to Twitter API.

## CLI Usage

You may also use it from the CLI, without using library functions. This is the recommended approach when using this with [Rettiwt-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rettiwt-api) for fetching data from Twitter. To login:

-   Install the package globally using the command:  
    `npm -g install rettiwt-auth`  
    **or**  
    `yarn global add rettiwt-auth`
-   Open a commandline/shell and use the command:  
    `login <email> <username> <password>`

Where,

-   \<email\> is the email to the Twitter account.
-   \<username\> is the username associated with the Twitter account.
-   \<password\> is the password to the Twitter account.

The generated credentials can then be used to authenticate requests to Twitter by passing in the respective headers.
